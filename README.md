Interpreting user needs is a key factor in developing a quality product that will be well liked and well used. The most important thing is to actively listen to try and understand what it is they are asking for. 
If in direct contact, then one is able to ask pointed and specific questions. Creating a user story based off of these communications is a critical part of SCRUM. Creating a user story and sharing it with the team
gives a feedback opportunity, further refinement of the specificity of the request, and viability. Creating user stories is a great way to organize thoughts and open it up to critique. I approach programs in a more 
holistic way after taking this class. Seeing the bigger picture is one that a developer needs to have in order to thrive. Seeing the big picture allows the developer to plan for situations that might hinder progress
in the present or some future time down the road. Planning for these inevitabilities will save many headaches in the future. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? It is quite a loaded question where people have written entire books on the subject. There are two active abilities that a good team member exhibits:
The ability to effectively communicate within their team and a drive to ensure that their work is the highest quality it can possibly be. The first is self-evident. The second encapsulates what a good "anything" should be.
A drive to have the highest quality of work includes a drive to always be willing to learn and being humble.
